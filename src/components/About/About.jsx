            I am a Software Engineer, passionate about building responsive and
            optimized web applications, with a strong foundation in Full-Stack
            Development.

            I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from Lovely Professional
            University (2024). During my sixth semester (July 2023), I secured
            my first campus offer for a one-year internship at CG Infinity as a
            Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern. This experience allowed
            me to gain hands-on expertise in both development and testing,
            enhancing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding
            of scalable web applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond the tech world, I have a deep passion for painting and
            creative arts, which allows me to express myself beyond code.
            Whether itâ€™s crafting digital experiences or bringing ideas to life
            on a canvas, creativity is at the core of everything I do.
